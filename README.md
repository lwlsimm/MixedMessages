# MixedMessages

## Task
This is a very simple programme that I undertook right at the start of my course with Codecademy after having covered off the basics of JS.  The task set was as follows:

>For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Solution

Using a series of arrays containing a subject, a verb, an object and an exclamation together with a random number generator function, the console will return a nonesensical predictaion made by Nostradamus.

## Technology

I will use javascript as the coding language and will use git version control (both locally and remotely using github).
